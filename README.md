I created 3 branches for each task. 
"task" is for task2 where the *.ipynb google colab file is, along with the heatmap produced
"task3" is the third task which contains the shiny app.R. Here I showed the data of the cytokine release from three ipsc-microglial lines, at different concentrations.
"task4" is the fourth task which has the pdf of the the images.
